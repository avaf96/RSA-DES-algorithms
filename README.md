RSA and DSA are two distinct cryptographic systems, each with its own specific applications. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a cryptosystem widely used for secure data transmission, where the encryption key is made public, but the decryption key remains private.<br>
On the other hand, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) focuses on digital signature generation and verification. Both of these cryptographic methods play an essential role in modern cybersecurity practices.<br><br>
In this work, key generation, encryption, and decryption functions for both RSA and DES algorithms were developed.
